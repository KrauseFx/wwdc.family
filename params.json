  "body": "# wwdc.family\r\n\r\nLet's start a location sharing group for an exciting WWDC week in San Francisco\r\n\r\n## How does it work\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Apple [removed the group feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2gzaju/has_temporary_disapeared_from_find_my_friends_in/) of the `Find my Friends` app.\r\n\r\nAs replacement we will use an iMessage group with location sharing enabled. You can opt-out any time.\r\n\r\n## Register\r\n\r\n[Fill out the Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/sweIs0R63MUHWpIh1) and wait for further instructions. \r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nSince we use an iMessage group, there will be potentially a lot of messages. I'd recommend muting the group.\r\n\r\n## Ideas\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas on how to make this experience the best possible, please get in touch with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx)\r\n\r\n> Organised by [Felix Krause](https://krausefx.com). wwdc.family is not affiliated with Apple Inc.",
